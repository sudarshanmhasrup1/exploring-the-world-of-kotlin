#### Trying Kotlin

Kotlin is a concise language with a lot of syntactic sugar, making it fun to write and great for turning ideas into
reality. To learn Kotlin, it's important to understand its most commonly used concepts. So, I’ve decided to create a
module that lists these key Kotlin concepts. You can refer to the official Kotlin documentation to learn more about each
one. Here’s the list of concepts:

1) `Hello World` in Kotlin.
2) Use of the `println()` function to display output.
3) Printing a whole paragraph using `""" ""` (triple quotes).
4) Single-line` and `multi-line` comment.
5) Use of the `val` keyword to declare immutable variables.
6) Use of the `var` keyword to declare mutable variable.
7) Use of `String templates` to smartly include value of variable into a string.
8) Use of `Template expression` to smartly include result of any expression into a string.
9) Commonly used data types in Kotlin: `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `Char` and `Double`.
