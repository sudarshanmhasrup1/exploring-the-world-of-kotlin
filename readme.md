### About this repository

My love for the Kotlin programming language is so pure. I discovered the Kotlin programming language
in 2023 when I was in the second year of my college. I've formerly worked in programming languages
like Java, JavaScript, C, and C++, but out of all of these, I found I enjoy Kotlin the most. This
repository contains all the source code I created in Kotlin, including a design system as well as
custom plugins to manage my workflow. This repository also contains code snippets and examples to
achieve certain features in our software using Kotlin. It also contains a multiplatform app as well
as a backend API, which demonstrates the power of Kotlin.

### Project structure

I'm using a multi-module approach to structure this project because it targets multiple
platformsâ€”Desktop (JVM), iOS (Native), and Android. Keeping all code in a single module isn't
practical in such cases. The project includes a reusable design system, a custom Gradle plugin for
centralized build logic, and more. Modularization improves reusability, maintainability, and keeps
the architecture clean and scalable.

- `/build-logic`: A custom plugin created to centralize and extract all reusable build logic for
  easier management and reuse. This module is a composite build included in the main project build
  using the `includeBuild()` function in`settings.gradle.kts`.
- `/learn-gradle`: This module was created for experimental purposes to learn how to create simple
  tasks in a Gradle module. It is for learning only and doesnâ€™t contain any useful source code, so
  it can be safely ignored.
- `/trying-kotlin`: A practice module to explore and understand Kotlin language features through
  hands-on coding. It includes basic examples and experiments for learning purposes.
- `/kotlin-playground`: A ready-to-use module for running experimental programs in a Kotlin JVM
  environment for testing purposes.
- `/android-app`: This is a regular android application module which consumes the android framework
  generated by Kotlin Multiplatform.
- `/compose-app`: This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project starter. It generates frameworks for  
  `Android`, `iOS`, and `Desktop` applications.

### Trying Kotlin

Kotlin is a concise and expressive language full of syntactic sugar, making coding enjoyable and
fast for turning ideas into real applications. This module covers the essential Kotlin features you
need to get started or refresh your knowledge. You can always refer to the
[official Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html) for deeper understanding.
Here's the list of topics covered:

1. Writing a basic `Hello World` program
2. Displaying output with `println()`
3. Printing multi-line text using triple quotes `""" """`
4. Writing single-line and multi-line comments
5. Declaring immutable variables with `val`
6. Declaring mutable variables with `var`
7. Using **string templates** to embed variables in strings
8. Using **template expressions** to embed expressions inside strings
9. Common data types: `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `Char`, and `Double`
10. Declaring functions with the `fun` keyword
11. Defining functions with input parameters
12. Calling functions using **named arguments**
13. Using **default arguments** in functions
14. Writing functions that return values
15. Difference between **block body** and **expression body** functions
16. Using `if` statements for conditional logic
17. Handling multiple conditions with `if-else`
18. Using the `in` keyword with ranges
19. Using the `when` statement as a replacement for `if-else` chains
20. Using `if-else` as an expression that returns a value
21. Using `when` as an expression that returns a value
22. Declaring nullable variables with the `?` operator
23. Using the safe call operator `?.` for nullable variables
24. Using the not-null assertion operator `!!` to force non-null access
25. Using the Elvis operator `?:` to provide default values
26. Utilizing the function reference operator `::`.
27. Defining a function without using the `fun` keyword.
28. Passing a function as an argument to another function.
29. Applying trailing lambda syntax for cleaner code.
30. Understanding OOP in Kotlin: `Classes`, `Objects`, `Class methods`, `Class properties`,
    `Primary constructor`,
    `Secondary constructor`
31. Understanding `Inheritance` in Kotlin along with `Overriding methods` in a child class, use of
    the `super` keyword.
32. Using `property delegates` to delegate work.
33. Looping in Kotlin using the `while` loop.
34. Looping in Kotlin using the `do-while` loop.
35. Looping in Kotlin using the `for` loop.
36. Operations on `strings`.
37. Creating and using `List` in Kotlin.
38. Creating and using `Set` in Kotlin.
39. Creating and using `Map` in Kotlin.
40. Using `enumeration` class to define a set of values.
41. Using `data class` to present data.
42. Use of `destructuring declarations`.
43. Creating a `extension function` for an existing class.
44. Creating a `extension property` for an existing class.

### Thank you ðŸ™Œ

I'm glad you took the time to look at this repository. I understand the struggle when someone is
learning a new language
or switching to a different one. I just want to sayâ€”believe meâ€”youâ€™ll start loving Kotlin more than
anything.
When I first started, I used to love Java and JavaScript. I thought Kotlin wouldnâ€™t replace them for
me, but here I am.
Now, every other language feels awkward if it's not Kotlin. All the best, and welcome to the world
of Kotlin. Thank you
so much for checking out this repository!
